It is important to understand that the current structure is primarily inspired by the recommended structure in the CW descrtiption

The structure of the folders which was used by me is here:

/root-folder
/controllers => the certain functions which work on a particular api endpoint
/data/mock_db.json => temporary database used for the project
/public => /scripts, /styles => folder for scripts and styles used for the frontend
/routes => /api, /web routes, api => endpoints for crud functionality controllers, web => routing on the fronend
/services => reusable functions
/views => pug files, e.g pages
/index.js => main file
